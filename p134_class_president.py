High school students are voting for their class president and youâ€™re
tasked with counting the votes. Each presidential candidates is
represented by a unique integer and the candidate that should win the
election is the candidate that has received more than half the votes.
Given a list of integers, return the candidate that should become the
class president.

Note: You may assume there is always a candidate that has received more
than half the votes.

Ex: Given the following votes...

votes = [1, 1, 2, 2, 1], return 1.
Ex: Given the following votes...

votes = [1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3], return 3.
