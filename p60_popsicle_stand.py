"""
Youâ€™re running a popsicle stand where each popsicle costs $5. Each
customer you encountered pays with either a $5 bill, a $10 bill, or a
$20 bill and only buys a single popsicle. The customers that come to
your stand come in the order given by the customers array where
customers[i] represents the bill the ith customer pays with. Starting
with $0, return whether or not you can serve all the given customers
while also giving the correct amount of change.

Ex: Given the following customers...

customers = [5, 10], return true
collect $5 from the first customer, pay no change.
collet $10 from the second customer and give back $5 change.

Ex: Given the following customers...

customers = [10], return false
Explanation:
collect $10 from the first customer and we cannot give back change.

Ex: Given the following customers...

customers = [5, 5, 5, 10, 20], return true
Explanation:
collect $5 from the first 3 customers.
collet $10 from the fourth customer and give back $5 change.
collect $20 from the fifth customer and give back $10 change
($10 bill and $5 bill).
