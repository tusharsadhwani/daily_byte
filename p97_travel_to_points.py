"""
Given N points on a Cartesian plane, return the minimum time required to
visit all points in the order that theyâ€™re given.

Note: You start at the first point and can move one unit vertically,
horizontally, or diagonally in a single second.

Ex: Given the following points...

points = [[0, 0], [1,1], [2,2]], return 2.
In one second we can travel from [0, 0] to [1, 1]
In another second we can travel from [1, 1,] to [2, 2]

Ex: Given the following points...

points = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 0]], return 5.
