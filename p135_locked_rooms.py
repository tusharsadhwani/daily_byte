This question is asked by Amazon. Given N distinct rooms that are locked
we want to know if you can unlock and visit every room. Each room has a
list of keys in it that allows you to unlock and visit other rooms. We
start with room 0 being unlocked. Return whether or not we can visit
every room.

Ex: Given the following rooms...

rooms = [[1], [2], []], return true

Ex: Given the following rooms...

rooms = [[1, 2], [2], [0], []], return false, we canâ€™t enter room 3.
